# BMI-Calculator
This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows users to input their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms. Additionally, it provides a guide section that highlights the BMI categories: Underweight, Normal Range, and Overweight, based on the calculated BMI value.
